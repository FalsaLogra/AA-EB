            <h2>Act I: Aurellya</h2>
            <p>
                In the hustle and bustle of Limsa Lominsa, Aurellya took an exhausted step through the wet ground. She looked upward to the cloudy night sky, where she hoped to see even a tiny glimmer of hope from the stars above. Her prayer was answered as she saw an angel in front of her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever since that day, she joined the merry band of ANGELs. Over time, Aurellya grew to care for her new friends. One day, as she was sitting on the bench outside of the FC house, a fellow Viera approached her. "What you queueing?" asked the Viera. She didn't know about it yet, but it was at this moment that Aurellya truly began to live.
            </p>

            <h2>Act II: Aezil</h2>
            <p>
                Months had passed, lots of memories had been experienced. Ever since the day he found her, Aezil's day has never been the same. With a calm and patient demeanor, Aezil did his best to guide her on her life journeys. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They grew closer, sharing fun and silly stories on the treehouse until midnight comes. It became second nature to come and be beside each other. They slowly realized how comfortable they were with each other.
            </p>

            <h2>Act III: Proposal</h2>
            <p>
                There was one thing Aezil doesn't like doing: parkour. One time, Aurellya managed to climb one of the tower near the FC house. It was a struggle, but she prevailed. As she conquered the tower, Aezil looked from the treehouse looking defeated. In the whim of the moment, she yelled to Aezil, "You can teleport to me!"
            </p>
            <p>
                One night, while they were hanging out on the treehouse, a question was asked. "Who do you have in mind for EB?" This was the moment where they started to think about their future. Aezil answered that he currently doesn't have anybody in mind, and they continued their talks as normal. Just before they leave, Aurellya stopped Aezil. She leaned closer to Aezil, and whispered, "I wouldn't mind."
            </p>
            <p>
                It was finally time for Aurellya to finish her journey. Aezil was there, waiting at the finish line with a determined self. He knew this was the perfect time. Fate had brought them together here at this exact moment. With a shy smile, Aezil looked up. There... he saw it. The infinite stars of the universe. It felt like they were all there to cheer him up, to say that everything will be okay. With a bouquet in hand, he prepared the pose for when Aurellya arrives. And the rest is history.
